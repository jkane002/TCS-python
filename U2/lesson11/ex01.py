'''
Suppose we are writing code to track different types of cars in a race. There
are three types of cars, a sports car, a van, and a truck. For one move, a
sports car moves 5 units forward, a van 3, and a truck 1. Each move uses
one unit of gas; and a sports car starts with 10 gallons, and van with 15 and
a truck with 25. Write some code using factory methods that tracks the gas and units
travelled of each vehicle.

Constraints
Assume you will never go into negative gas

1. What is class variable and instance variable?

2. Template for class
class ClassName:
    class variable = 'initialize value'
    def i n i t (self, passed in variable ):
        self.instance variable = passed in variable
    def class method(self, argument):
        # do something with argument
        return 'some result obtained'

3. Change modifications
    Why do we need to change modifications?
    To change the access permissions of file system object
    chmod 777
    owner, group, others
    7 means to read, write, and execute
    The octal numeral system is the base-8 number system, and uses the digits 0 to 7.
    now can run more simply
    instead of "py ex01.py"
    use "./ex01.py"
    faster to type ./ then click tab
